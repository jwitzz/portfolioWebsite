        <p>
            After over 20 years working as a Lead Pharmacy Technician in a compounding pharmacy, I developed a deep appreciation for problem-solving, precision, and leadership. 
            In that role, I managed teams, solved complex challenges daily, and thrived in a highly detailed, fast-paced environment.
          </p>

            My passion for coding and software engineering grew naturally from my love of solving problems and building systems that work. Today, I’m excited to bring my 
            leadership experience, attention to detail, and dedication to quality into the world of web development and software engineering.
          </p>

            I’m currently focused on building web applications that are both functional and beautifully designed. I believe the same care and craftsmanship that goes into 
            compounding a perfect formula also belongs in writing clean, effective code.
